# Practicing Input and Output

This assignment will have you practice receiving text input from a user and producing text output to the Python command line.

## Details

This project includes some starter code as well as some tests that will help you determine whether you have written the solution code correctly or not.

### Starter code files

There are two starter code files:

- **practice_input.py**
- **practice_output.py**

### Filling in the functions

Both have some pre-defined functions. Each function has instructions for what code to write and place within it.

In order to properly place code within a function, the code within the function must be indented underneath the function definition.

For example, take this function starter code in the file, `practice_output.py`:

```python
def print_with_line_break():
  """
  Prints out the text, 'Hello world!' with a line break at the end
  """
  # write your code here
```

The code to solve this problem must be indented below the function definition, such as:

```python
def print_with_line_break():
  """
  Prints out the text, 'Hello world!' with a line break at the end
  """
  # write your code here
  print("Hello world!")
```

Note that the `print("Hello world!")` line is indented the same as the line above it, which is one tab to the right of the line that says, `def print_with_line_break():`. Keep this indentation.

### Testing your work

Included in the given code are some tests, using the **pytest** testing framework. These tests should all pass if the code in each function is done correctly.
